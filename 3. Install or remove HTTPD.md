1.1 Write an ansible playbook named 'httpd-setup.yml' to install httpd in the nodes of 'demo' group
```
--- # install httpd on nodes of demo group
- hosts: demo
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: install httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: latest
```
1.2 Configure the playbook to start and enable the httpd service on the demo group.
    ```
    - name: start and enable httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started enabled=yes
```
1.3 Configure the playbook to retrieve the website from http://repo.example.com/website.tgz on each server in the demo group.
```
- name: retrieve website from repo
      get_url: url=http://repo.example.com/website.tgz dest=/tmp/website.tgz
  ```
1.4 Configure the playbook to unarchive the website into /var/www/html on all servers in the demogroup.
    ```
    - name: install website
      unarchive: remote_src=yes src=/tmp/website.tgz dest=/var/www/html/
```
1.5 The final yam file will look something like this:
```
--- # install httpd on demo group
- hosts: demo
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: install httpd
      yum: name=httpd state=latest
    - name: start and enable httpd
      service: name=httpd state=started enabled=yes
    - name: retrieve website from repo
      get_url: url=http://repo.example.com/website.tgz dest=/tmp/website.tgz
    - name: install website
      unarchive: remote_src=yes src=/tmp/website.tgz dest=/var/www/html/
```
1.6 to check the website content scripts
```
curl node1/home.html
```

2. Write an ansible playbook named 'httpd-setup.yml' to stop and disable httpd in the nodes of 'demo' group
```
--- # disable and stop httpd on nodes of demo group
- hosts: demo
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: stop and disable httpd
      service: name=httpd state=stopped enabled=no
  ```

Write an ansible playbook named 'httpd-setup.yml' to remove httpd in the nodes of 'demo' group
```
--- # remove / uninstall httpd on nodes of demo group
- hosts: demo
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: remove httpd
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: absent
```
