1. Write an ansible playbook named 'nginx-setup.yml' to install nginx, start nginx, get nginx server IP, display nginx server IP, verify Nginx deployment and show a message daying nginx landing page is accessible in the nodes of 'demo' group.
  
[NOTE]: I did this practical on Amazon Linux 2 AMI. I had to download and install epel-release-7 files on the nodes in order for nginx to install.

```
--- # Playbook to install, start, display, deploy and show the landing page of Nginx server
- name: Deploy and verify Nginx
  hosts: demo
  become: yes  # This ensures the tasks run with elevated privileges
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx on Amazon Linux 2 from EPEL repository
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      become: yes

    - name: Start Nginx service on Amazon Linux 2
      systemd:
        name: nginx
        state: started

    - name: Get Nginx server IP
      set_fact:
        nginx_server_ip: "{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"

    - name: Display Nginx server IP
      debug:
        msg: "The IP address of the Nginx server is {{ nginx_server_ip }}"

    - name: Verify Nginx deployment
      uri:
        url: "http://{{ nginx_server_ip }}"
        status_code: 200
      register: nginx_response

    - name: Show Nginx landing page
      debug:
        msg: "Nginx landing page is accessible"
      when: nginx_response.status == 200
```

2. Write an ansible playbook named 'nginx-setup.yml' to stop and remove Nginx
```
--- # Playbook to stop and remove Nginx server
- name: Stop and remove Nginx
  hosts: demo
  become: yes  # This ensures the tasks run with elevated privileges
  tasks:
    - name: Stop Nginx service on Amazon Linux 2
      systemd:
        name: nginx
        state: stopped

    - name: Remove Nginx on Amazon Linux 2
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: absent
      become: yes
```
