Write a playbook called ```loop.yml``` to install ```httpd```, ```nginx``` and ```git``` on your nodes.
```
--- # Install a list of packages
- name: Install packages
  hosts: your_group
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install packages
      package:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - httpd
        - nginx
        - git
```
