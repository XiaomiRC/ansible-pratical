Write a playbook to ```install``` and ``start``` ```httpd```. Use a handler so that module for starting ```httpd``` runs after installing it.
```
--- # Install and start Apache
- name: Install Apache
  hosts: demo
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Installing Apache
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: latest
      notify: Start Apache

  handlers:
    - name: Start Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
```
