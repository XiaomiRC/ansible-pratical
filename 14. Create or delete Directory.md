1. Write a playbook called ```dir.yml``` to create a directory on nodes
```
--- # Create directory
- name: Create directory
  hosts: your_group
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create directory
      file:
        path: /path/to/directory-name
        state: directory
```
[NOTE] change the ```state``` to ```absent``` in order to delete the directory from nodes.
