Write a file called 'users.yml' to create the users `developer` and `sys_admin` on your nodes.
```
--- # Create Users on Nodes
- hosts: demo
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: create developer user
      user:
        name: developer
        state: present
    - name: create sys_admin user
      user:
        name: sys_admin
        state: present
```
