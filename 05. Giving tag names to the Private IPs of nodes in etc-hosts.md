# Declare the Private IP of Nodes in the /etc/hosts
We can do this so that we do not have to type in the Private IP of the Node in the command ``` ssh ansible@PrivateIPOfNode```, each time that we are SSHing into our nodes from our Ansible Server

1.1 Become the Root user and open /etc/hosts file
```
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```

1.2 At the end of the file pop in the Private IP address of Node1 and Node2 and the shortnames which you want to give the IPs
```
172.31.34.86  node1
172.31.41.10  node2
```
Save and Quit

2. Try SSHing into the ansible user of Node1 and Node2 from Ansible Server without using the Private IP
```
ssh ansible@node1
```
```
ssh ansible@node2
```
